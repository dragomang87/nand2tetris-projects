@value or @variable // A=value or A=variable (A directive)
destination = computation; jump // C directive
// destination is any subset of A, D and M (eg, empty, A, D, M, AM AD DM, ADM)
// computation is any operation provided by ALU with ADM registers
// JUMP is any of jump strings satisfying any subset of less, equal or greater
//      it jumps to the assembly line stored in A, so jump directives are almost always preceded by an @ directive (A directive

@new_string // assign new unused register address to new_string

(LOCATION) // Define LOCATION = line number of next instruction


// array
// RAM[array_start] = address of array first element
// RAM[length=array_start] = length of array
