# nand2tetris-projects

This repository contains my own solutions to the course nand2tetris
available at [nand2tetris.org](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) and Coursera (divided in Part I and II).
The difference from the plain solutions asked by the course is that
I try to also implement syntax checks in the compilers,
while the assignments say to assume that the various codes are free of syntax errors.
My reason to implement syntax checking is that detecting syntax error with one compilers
might give hints on what the compiler in the layer above did wrong.
